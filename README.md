# Personal Dashboard

This is an example project for learning Google Polymer and Web Components. I've created this repository for my workshop at [IrDevConf](http://conf.wsschool.org/devconf/).

### Walkthrough

You could follow the [walkthrough.md](walkthrough.md) file to create the project from scratch.

### Setup

##### Prerequisites

Install [polymer-cli](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer-cli):

    npm install -g bower polymer-cli

##### Install dependencies:
Install all dependencies via bower:

    bower install

### Start the development server

This command serves the app at `http://localhost:8080` and provides basic URL
routing for the app:

    polymer serve


### Build

This command performs HTML, CSS, and JS minification on the application
dependencies, and generates a service-worker.js file with code to pre-cache the
dependencies based on the entrypoint and fragments specified in `polymer.json`.
The minified files are output to the `build/unbundled` folder, and are suitable
for serving from a HTTP/2+Push compatible server.

In addition the command also creates a fallback `build/bundled` folder,
generated using fragment bundling, suitable for serving from non
H2/push-compatible servers or to clients that do not support H2/Push.

    polymer build

### Test the build

This command serves the minified version of the app in an unbundled state, as it would
be served by a push-compatible server:

    polymer serve build/unbundled

This command serves the minified version of the app generated using fragment bundling:

    polymer serve build/bundled
